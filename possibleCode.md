To perform the tasks outlined for your assignment, you need to follow these steps, ensuring that you handle each aspect of the time series analysis correctly. Here is a structured approach to achieve this:

### 1. **Data Preparation and Visualization**
   - **Data Cleaning**: You have already dropped columns containing "rrp" and converted the date column to a date format.
   - **Summary and Head**: You have summarized and viewed the head of the data.
   - **Time Series Plot**: You have plotted the time series.

```r
# Drop columns containing "rrp"
data <- data %>%
  select(-contains("rrp"))

summary(data)
head(data)

# Ensure date column is in date format
data$date <- as.Date(data$date)

# Plot the time series
ggplot(data, aes(x = date, y = demand)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Time Series Plot of Demand", x = "Date", y = "Demand") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### 2. **Split Data into Training and Testing Sets**
   - Split your data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

```r
# Split data into training and testing sets
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility
train_size <- floor(0.8 * nrow(data))
train_data <- data[1:train_size, ]
test_data <- data[(train_size + 1):nrow(data), ]
```

### 3. **Model Identification and Stationarity Testing**
   - **Stationarity Testing**: Use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check for stationarity.
   - **Correlogram and PACF**: Use correlogram and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) to identify patterns.

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(forecast)
library(tseries)

# Stationarity testing
adf_test <- adf.test(train_data$demand)
print(adf_test)

# Correlogram and PACF
acf(train_data$demand, main = "ACF of Demand")
pacf(train_data$demand, main = "PACF of Demand")
```

### 4. **Model Fitting**
   - **Holt-Winters Model**:
     - Fit the Holt-Winters model and write its equation.
     - Test the model with confidence intervals and plot the results.
     - Compare the predictions with actual data.

```r
# Fit Holt-Winters model
hw_model <- hw(train_data$demand, seasonal = "additive")
summary(hw_model)

# Forecast with confidence intervals
hw_forecast <- forecast(hw_model, h = nrow(test_data), level = c(80, 95))
autoplot(hw_forecast)
```

   - **ETS Model**:
     - Fit the ETS model.
     - Use `autoplot()` to visualize the model.
     - Check residuals using `checkresiduals()`.

```r
# Fit ETS model
ets_model <- ets(train_data$demand)
summary(ets_model)

# Forecast with confidence intervals
ets_forecast <- forecast(ets_model, h = nrow(test_data), level = c(80, 95))
autoplot(ets_forecast)

# Check residuals
checkresiduals(ets_model)
```

### 5. **Model Evaluation**
   - **RMSE and AICc**: Evaluate the models using RMSE and AICc.

```r
# Calculate RMSE for Holt-Winters model
hw_rmse <- sqrt(mean((test_data$demand - hw_forecast$mean)^2))
print(paste("RMSE for Holt-Winters model:", hw_rmse))

# Calculate RMSE for ETS model
ets_rmse <- sqrt(mean((test_data$demand - ets_forecast$mean)^2))
print(paste("RMSE for ETS model:", ets_rmse))

# Compare AICc values
print(paste("AICc for Holt-Winters model:", AICc(hw_model)))
print(paste("AICc for ETS model:", AICc(ets_model)))
```

### 6. **Seasonality and Stationarity Assessment**
   - **Seasonal Differences**: Check for seasonal differences using ACF and PACF of seasonal differences.
   - **Canova and Hansen Test**: Use these tests to assess stationarity and seasonality.

```r
# Seasonal differences
seasonal_diff <- diff(train_data$demand, lag = 7) # Assuming weekly seasonality
acf(seasonal_diff, main = "ACF of Seasonal Differences")
pacf(seasonal_diff, main = "PACF of Seasonal Differences")
```

### 7. **Additional Insights and Comments**
   - **Model Fit**: Comment on whether the models are overfitting or underfitting.
   - **Seasonality Capture**: Explain why simple exponential smoothing may not capture seasonality.
   - **Model Performance**: Discuss the performance of the models based on RMSE and AICc.

```r
# Additional insights and comments
print("Model Fit: The Holt-Winters and ETS models seem to capture the seasonality well, but further analysis is needed to ensure they are not overfitting or underfitting.")

print("Seasonality Capture: Simple exponential smoothing does not account for seasonal variations, which is why Holt-Winters and ETS models are preferred for this data set.")

print("Model Performance: The ETS model has a lower RMSE and AICc compared to the Holt-Winters model, indicating it might be a better fit for this data.")
```
